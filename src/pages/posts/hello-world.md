### 🧠 It Started as a Game

I’ve been playing fantasy basketball for 4 seasons. It started as a way to stay connected to the league. But somewhere along the way, it turned into something bigger.

I wasn’t just watching box scores. I was building rosters. Studying rotations. Predicting value. Thinking like a GM.

And that mindset didn’t stay on the app—it followed me into the real-world basketball ops work I do today.

### 🏆 The Track Record

- 📅 4 full seasons
- 📈 Made the playoffs every year
- 🥇 Won the championship once

The numbers are cool, but they’re not the story. What matters is **how I got there**.

### 📊 My Fantasy Ops Stack

Fantasy basketball, for me, isn’t luck, it’s logic.

Every off-season, I:
- Build spreadsheets to **project stats** based on team changes, new coaches, and usage rate shifts
- Analyze depth charts and **identify bench players** with breakout potential
- Watch games specifically to study **rotation patterns** and **coach behavior**

This isn’t just player scouting. It’s understanding the **ecosystem of a team**, something I’ve applied to every real-world basketball operation I’ve led since.

### 🔁 Fantasy → Real-World Decisions

When I ran a 32-team tournament, I used similar logic:
- Built balanced rosters with rules to ensure diversity and parity
- Adjusted brackets based on real-time data (dropouts, injuries, absences)
- Scouted talent across matchups to assign referees to the right games

In other words:  
> I treated the tournament like a **real-life fantasy roster** — constantly adjusting variables to produce the most competitive, fun, and fair outcomes.

### 🧠 What It Taught Me

Playing fantasy basketball taught me to:
- 💡 Think in projections, not just points
- ⏳ Plan for long-term value, not short-term flash
- 🔁 Adapt to changes in rotations, systems, or game pace
- 🔍 Watch basketball **like an operator**, not just a fan

I now see the NBA as a web of interlocking systems: coaching decisions, player usage, injury risk, cap management, and I owe that lens, in part, to years of fantasy strategy.

### 🔗 Why It Matters for Ops

The best basketball operators aren’t just reactive.  
They anticipate. They analyze. They prepare.

Fantasy gave me a playground to build those muscles.  
Real ops gave me the arena to use them.

And I can’t wait to keep learning, in bigger roles, on bigger courts, with higher stakes.
