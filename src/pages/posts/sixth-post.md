### 🏀 From Ref to Operator

When I first joined the University of Guelph's intramural basketball program, I was just looking to be involved. Four seasons later, I had become a go-to referee, operations leader, and systems builder, helping run a league of over **50 teams** across recreational and competitive tiers.

And I loved it.

### 📅 Scheduling the Season

As a site admin on **IMLeagues.ca**, I built and managed weekly schedules for dozens of teams, each with its own availability, division, and preferred competitiveness.

I handled:
- Team registration and confirmation
- Weekly schedule creation
- Court assignments
- Email communication with all captains

Every Sunday felt like game day... because it was. I didn't just make sure the league ran, I made sure it ran **smoothly**.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Game Day: On the Whistle

With multiple games happening simultaneously, I rotated roles with other refs, but as I gained experience, I became a **senior figure**.

By Season 2, I was:
- Assisting newer refs with tough in-game calls
- Resolving player disputes quickly and professionally
- Managing game flow for high-intensity matchups

The more competitive the game, the higher the stakes, and that’s where I thrived.

### 📊 Tracking the Game Like Ops

Officiating wasn’t just about blowing whistles. I tracked:
- **Scores**
- **Fouls**
- **Standout player stats** for MVP recognition

This data helped teams **feel seen**, and drove player engagement. When someone plays their heart out and gets recognized for it? That’s what brings them back next season.

And that showed: **player retention increased by 15%** over my time in the role.

### 🏆 Recognition That Meant Something

Throughout my 4 seasons, I received **multiple Official of the Week awards**, not just for consistent rule enforcement, but for managing **sportsmanship**, **conflict resolution**, and **smooth ops**.

It wasn’t about blowing the whistle. It was about making the game **better**.

### 🔁 What I Took Away

Running a league every week taught me more than any classroom could:
- Scheduling and logistics are living systems
- People problems will always exist, how you manage them is your legacy
- Referees are unsung operators of the game

When I think about basketball operations, I don’t just think about clipboards and court time.  
I think about **systems, fairness, communication, and care**.

And I’m ready to bring all of that to the next level, court-side with the NBA.
