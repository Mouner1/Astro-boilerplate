### 🏀 The Vision

In Winter 2024, as President of the Middle Eastern Students Association at the University of Guelph, I set out to create more than just a tournament, I wanted to build a **space where culture, sport, and inclusion met on the court**.

We hosted a 32-team basketball tournament in the university gym, welcoming over 250 participants. But this wasn’t just about the numbers, it was about what the format *stood for*.

### 👥 Gender-Inclusive by Design

Every team consisted of 8 players: 4 men and 4 women. During gameplay, **a minimum of 2 women had to be on the court at all times**. This wasn’t optional. It was built into the format to ensure balance, representation, and equity, something the sports world still needs more of.

This rule didn’t just meet a requirement, it **challenged strategy**, **deepened collaboration**, and **highlighted the talent of every athlete**.

### 📋 Tournament Operations

**Role:** I led this event from end-to-end, as president, coordinator, referee, and problem-solver.

Here's what I managed:
- ✅ Venue setup at the U of Guelph gym
- 🧃 Distribution of drinks, snacks, and first aid kits
- 💻 Registration via Microsoft Forms → Excel automation
- 🏆 Designed and managed a 32-team elimination bracket
- 💵 Payment tracking and confirmation (with all proceeds donated)

Games were played in two 15-minute halves. I refereed many of them myself, drawing on my experience officiating our weekly intramural leagues, ensuring **fairness**, **consistency**, and **respect for the game**.

---

### 🧠 Problem-Solving in Real Time

As expected with events of this scale, we had **last-minute dropouts**. But my executive team was ready. With 15 trained volunteers (men and women), we filled empty spots seamlessly, keeping gameplay running smoothly without compromising fairness or format.

We didn’t panic. We adapted. That’s operations.

### ❤️ Impact Beyond the Court

- 📈 Raised **over $1,000** for charitable donation
- 🏀 Enabled inclusive competition across hundreds of students
- ✨ Created visibility for women in sport through structure, not suggestion
- 🔁 Received glowing feedback from players and attendees alike

This event proved that **basketball can be more than a game**, it can be a platform for equity, unity, and leadership.

### 🔁 What I Learned

Organizing this tournament taught me what it really means to run a basketball operation. It's not just:
- Putting up hoops
- Filling brackets
- Printing rules

It’s about designing for impact, making inclusion operational, not optional.  
It’s about being ready for the chaos that comes with people, and turning it into flow.

And it’s about **leading through the lens of basketball**, which is exactly what I hope to keep doing, on bigger courts, with bigger stakes.

*Thanks to everyone who made this tournament unforgettable.*  
Let’s keep building more spaces where everyone gets a shot, literally and figuratively.
